# prerecoreded-transcription-notebook

The notebook in this repository takes as input an audio file(s) of your choice and your Deepgram API Key (signup [here](https://dpgr.am/youtube) to receive one). The output will be a transcript of the audio.

By default, the starter code is set up to provide English subtitles, but you can change this by checking out our language documentation [here](https://dpgr.am/0b7655b)

Note: This .ipynb file was written in Google Colab. For the best results, we recommend running it there. Nevertheless, all the instructions needed to understand the notebook are embedded within the file's text and comments.

You can also consult [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocvilXRtOGM) for a tutorial and demo! Note, that the results look like [this](https://youtu.be/ocvilXRtOGM?t=127)
